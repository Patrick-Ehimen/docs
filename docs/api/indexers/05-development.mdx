## Integrating

To integrate the Sablier V2 indexers into your own product, start from the official `@sablier/v2-subgraphs` repository.
We recommend using:

- [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started) to create types from your GraphQL
  fragments and queries
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) to fetch results from the exposed endpoints.

## Contributing

To contribute to the V2 indexers (Envio x Sablier) or deploy your own, head over to the GitHub
[`v2-subgraphs`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-subgraphs) repository. Get started by reviewing the
`apps/protocol-envio` directory.

To bootstrap an indexer project, run the following commands. They will install the requisite dependencies and generate
the code for a multi-chain deployment.

```bash
cd ./packages/core
pnpm install
pnpm run setup

# OR

pnpm dev
```

You'll find a local Hasura process at `http://localhost:8080` which also includes a `GraphQL` endpoint to query locally.
To deploy without hosting yourself, have a look at the Envio
[Hosted Service](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hosted-service) docs.
