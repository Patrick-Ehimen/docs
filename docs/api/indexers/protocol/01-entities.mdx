:::info

For an introduction into the base Sablier primitives and some architectural choices, make sure to check out the
[protocol subgraph](/api/subgraphs/protocol/entities) before reading about the protocol-envio indexer.

The same (or similar) entities are used throughout both The Graph and Envio setups, as well as protocol and merkle
deployments.

:::

## Entity Architecture

Entities mirror those used inside the `protocol` subgraph. Read more in the
[dedicated section](/api/subgraphs/protocol/entities).

These are also defined in the `schema.graphql` file of each indexer.
