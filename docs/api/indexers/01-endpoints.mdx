:::tip Chains: Individual vs. Aggregated

While subgraphs have a chain-focused approach (one subgraph endpoint/deployment for every chain), it is important to
note that Envio will index all chains within the same deployment. This makes is so data from all chains is available to
query from the same place.

:::

:::note

The Sablier Envio indexers are still under development so links may change in time. Please reach out if the endpoints
don't work any more

:::

## Sablier V2 - Protocol-Envio

The `protocol-envio` indexer tracks events mainly emitted by the
[`@sablier/v2-core`](/contracts/v2/reference/overview#core) contracts. It deals with core protocol actions like
creating, withdrawing or transferring streams.

### Endpoints

| Chain            | Endpoint (Hosted Network)                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| All-Networks[^1] | https://indexer.bigdevenergy.link/be2052e/v1/graphql |

Use [Hasura's online explorer](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?) to view the entities and query API.

## Sablier V2 - Merkle-Envio (Airstreams)

This subgraph tracks events emitted by the [`@sablier/v2-periphery`](/contracts/v2/reference/overview#periphery)
contracts, specifically the
[`Merkle Factory`](/contracts/v2/reference/periphery/contract.SablierV2MerkleStreamerFactory). It deals with airstream
specific actions like the factory creating a campaign, admin clawbacks or users claiming streams as defined in the
attached Merkle tree.

### Endpoints
