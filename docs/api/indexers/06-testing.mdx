## Integrating

To ensure Envio indexers are delivering the same set of data as The Graph's subgraphs we've implemented a set of
differentials tests over both `merkle` and `protocol` configurations.

Check them out inside the `apps/[...]/test/` folders.

## Running

The differentials tests are powered by Jest. Inside `test/setup/constants.ts` you will find the full configuration for
these tests. This is where you'll also be able to toggle between using the local endpoint (see
[development](/api/indexers/development) to bootstrap a project locally) and the hosted-service one, using the `REMOTE`
flag.

```bash
pnpm run test
```

:::info

As the set of streams or campaigns grows, the final tests (full-coverage over the entire list of elements) may start
timing out. We suggest either splitting them chunks or simply adding a manual limit to the number of iterations the loop
can cover at once. Alternatively, one can also increase the timeout of those tests.
