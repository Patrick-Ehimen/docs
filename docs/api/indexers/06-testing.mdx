## Integrating

To ensure Envio indexers deliver the same data as The Graph's subgraphs, we've written differential tests over our
`merkle` and `protocol` configurations.

Check them out inside the `apps/[...]/test/` folders.

## Running

The differentials tests are powered by Jest. Inside `test/setup/constants.ts`, you will find the full configuration for
these tests. This is where you'll also be able to toggle between using the local endpoint (see
[development](/api/indexers/development) to bootstrap a project locally) and the hosted-service one, using the `REMOTE`
flag.

```bash
pnpm run test
```

:::info

As the set of streams or campaigns grows, the final tests (full coverage over the entire list of elements) may time out.
We suggest either splitting them in chunks or setting a manual limit to the number of iterations the loop can cover at
once. Alternatively, you could also try increasing the timeout of the tests.
