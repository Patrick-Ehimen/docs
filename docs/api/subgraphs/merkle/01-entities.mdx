For an introduction into the base Sablier primitives and some architectural choices, make sure to check out the
[protocol subgraph](/api/subgraphs/protocol/entities) before reading about the merkle subgraph.

## Entity Architecture

Inside the **merkle** subgraph, the
[`schema.graphql`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-subgraphs/blob/main/apps/merkle/schema.graphql) file is
responsible of defining the following Sablier entities:

### Primary

| Entity   | Description                                                                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Factory  | Instances of `SablierV2MerkleStreamerFactory`                                                                              |
| Campaign | Instances of `SablierV2MerkleStreamerLL`, the primary entity tracking the up to date state of an Airstream/Merkle campaign |
| Action   | Emitted events transformed into historical entries (e.g. Claim, Create, Clawback)                                          |
| Activity | An entity tracking daily usage (one item per day) for each campaign (e.g. amount claimed per day)                          |
| Asset    | The ERC20 asset that is being streamed                                                                                     |

### Secondary

| Entity  | Description                                                                                   |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Watcher | A singleton data store for subgraph-level unique indexes such as the campaign or action index |

## Structure

The structure of these entities is built on the same rules and mindset which was applied on the
[protocol entities](/api/subgraphs/protocol/structure).

## Data Flow

The data flow applied to this subgraph is identical to the one used in the
[protocol subgraph](/api/subgraphs/protocol/flow).
