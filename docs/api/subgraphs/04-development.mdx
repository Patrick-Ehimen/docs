## Integrating

To integrate the Sablier V2 subgraph or indexers into your own product, start from the official `@sablier/v2-subgraphs`
repository. We recommend using:

- [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started) to create types from your GraphQL
  fragments and queries
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) to fetch results from the exposed endpoints.

## Contributing

To contribute to the V2 subgraphs or deploy your own, head over to the GitHub
[`v2-subgraphs`](https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-subgraphs) repository. Get started by reviewing the `apps/protocol`
directory.

To bootstrap a subgraph project, run the following commands. They will install the requisite dependencies and generate
the code for a Sepolia deployment.

```bash
cd ./packages/core
yarn install
yarn setup:sepolia
```

To deploy a new subgraph on Sepolia:

1. Create a new item using The Graph's hosted network
2. Add its name/endpoint under the `deploy:sepolia` script in `package.json`
3. Add your own Sablier V2 contract addresses in `../constants/chains/sepolia.ts`
4. Make sure you're [authenticated][the-graph-auth] on your local machine
5. Run `yarn deploy:sepolia`

You can read more about how the The Graph works in their [official docs][the-graph-docs].
