## Create: `/api/create`

Call this route to create a new Merkle/Airstream campaign.

### Prerequisites

You need to obtain:

- The `decimals` of the asset you're basing the campaign upon
- A CSV file including a list of `[address, amount]` for every campaign recipient

:::tip

The CSV will contain a header row, followed by pairs of addresses and amounts. The amounts will be in humanized form, as
the API deals with the padding of each value (with the decimals of the token) on its own.
