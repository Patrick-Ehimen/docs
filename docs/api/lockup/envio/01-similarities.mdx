# Similarities

Envio indexers are designed to mirror the functionality and structure of the The Graph subgraphs.

For an introduction into the Sablier primitives and our architectural choices, check out the
[Lockup subgraph](/api/lockup/the-graph/entities) before reading about the `lockup-envio` indexer.

Similar entities are used between The Graph and Envio setups, as well as between the Lockup and Merkle deployments.
