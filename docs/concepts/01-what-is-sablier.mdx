## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To start with, it would be helpful to clarify the differences between the various components of "Sablier", some of which
may confuse new users.

- **The Sablier Protocol**: A collection of persistent, non-upgradeable smart contracts that together create a protocol
  which facilitates streaming of ERC-20 assets on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains.
- **The Sablier Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Sablier Protocol. The interface
  is only one of many ways to interact with the Sablier Protocol.
- **Sablier Labs**: the company that developed the Sablier Protocol, the user interfaces associated with it, and the
  documentation website you are reading now.
- **Sablier V1**: the first version of **The Sablier Protocol**, originally released in 2019.
- **Sablier V2**: the latest version of **The Sablier Protocol**.
